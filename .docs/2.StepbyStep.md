# Step-by-Step Implementation Plan for Multi-Tenant SaaS MMM Solution

## Introduction
Welcome to the comprehensive implementation plan for building a Multi-Tenant SaaS Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) solution using Next.js (for front-end) and Python (for back-end) with mock data. These instructions assume:

1. You have a freshly set-up project directory (with dependencies like Next.js and Python-related packages already installed).
2. You have an environment where Next.js will serve the front-end and Python-based back-end services will handle data processing tasks.

Below is a detailed, step-by-step approach, written in a clear, task-oriented style.

## 1. Preparation & Project Structure ‚úÖ

**‚úÖ Step 1:** Set up your working directory with separate folders for the front-end (Next.js) and the back-end (Python).  
- Created `frontend/` for Next.js code and `backend/` for Python code.  
- Established shared configuration resources.

**‚úÖ Step 2:** Confirm your `.gitignore` includes typical Node.js and Python artifacts.  
- Added proper ignores for `node_modules/` and Python `__pycache__/`.

**‚úÖ Step 3:** Create a basic `README.md` describing your project goals, environment, and any dependencies or local run instructions.  
- Created documentation to help new contributors understand the scope of the MMM solution.

---

## 2. UI Layout & Routing in Next.js ‚úÖ

**‚úÖ Step 1:** Create a `pages/` or `app/` directory (depending on your Next.js version) for your routes.  
- Implemented using Next.js App Router with `app/` directory structure.

**‚úÖ Step 2:** Inside `app/`, add pages for:
- ‚úÖ `/`: Main tenant dashboard displaying key MMM metrics.
- ‚úÖ `/dashboard`: Tenant-specific dashboard with key metrics.
- ‚úÖ `/results`: Detailed MMM analysis reports.
- ‚úÖ `/settings`: Basic tenant configuration screen for branding customization.
- ‚úÖ `/admin`: Admin panel for managing tenants and platform settings.

**‚úÖ Step 3:** Implement a global layout component that wraps all pages.  
- Created reusable layout components with header, navigation, and content areas.
- Added theming support for dark/light mode.

**‚úÖ Step 4:** Add routing logic or middleware for subdomain detection.  
- Implemented middleware to detect and process tenant subdomains.
- Created tenant context system to make tenant config available throughout the app.

---

## 3. Data Simulation & Mock Endpoints ‚ö†Ô∏è

**‚úÖ Step 1:** Inside your Python `backend/`, set up a simple web framework or route definitions.
- Placeholder structure for Python backend created.

**‚úÖ Step 2:** Decide on the shape of your mock data.  
- Created structured mock data for marketing spend and performance metrics.

**‚úÖ Step 3:** Prepare the mock data in JavaScript format for front-end development.
- Added tenant-specific mock data for development.

**‚≠ï Step 4:** Create Python endpoints to serve this mock data.  
- TODO: Implement FastAPI or Flask endpoints for MMM data.

**üîÑ Step 5:** In Next.js, add a utility or hook that calls these Python endpoints.  
- Basic API utility functionality in place, needs to be connected to real endpoints.

---

## 4. Tenant-Aware Branding (Minor Customization) ‚úÖ

**‚úÖ Step 1:** Decide on a simple theming strategy.  
- Implemented primary/secondary color scheme and logo per tenant.

**‚úÖ Step 2:** Create a config file in the front-end listing brand assets for each tenant.
- Created `tenants.ts` with detailed configuration for each tenant.

**‚úÖ Step 3:** In your global layout, detect which tenant is active.  
- Added middleware and context providers to track active tenant.
- Implemented local storage and cookie-based tenant persistence.

**‚úÖ Step 4:** Use the tenant's color scheme on key UI elements.
- Applied tenant branding across all tenant-specific pages.
- Created settings page for tenants to customize their branding.

---

## 5. Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) Setup üîÑ

**‚úÖ Step 1:** Create a new module in your Python `backend/` directory.  
- Set up directory structure for MMM functionality.

**‚≠ï Step 2:** Design a pipeline for data ingestion, transformation, modeling, and predictions.  
- TODO: Create data processing pipeline for marketing data.

**‚≠ï Step 3:** Decide on a library or technique for MMM.  
- TODO: Implement MMM algorithms (regression or Bayesian methods).

**‚≠ï Step 4:** Prepare a function that returns key coefficients and metrics.
- TODO: Create output formatting for MMM results.

**‚≠ï Step 5:** Provide an endpoint in the Python back-end to run or retrieve MMM calculations.
- TODO: Set up API endpoints for MMM model execution.

---

## 6. Integration Between Front-End & Back-End ‚ùå

**üîÑ Step 1:** In the Next.js app, define a set of JavaScript functions or React hooks for calling the MMM endpoints.  
- Created utility structure, but actual implementation pending.

**‚≠ï Step 2:** On your front-end pages, display aggregated or high-level metrics from the MMM results.  
- TODO: Connect dashboard charts to API data.

**‚≠ï Step 3:** For the `/results` page, retrieve the more detailed MMM output.

**‚úÖ Step 3:** Test that each subdomain can only access its own data and that branding is correct.  
- Implemented and tested tenant isolation via middleware.

**‚úÖ Step 4:** Finalize your documentation with setup instructions.
- Created comprehensive documentation in .docs/ directory.

**üîÑ Step 5:** Perform a final run-through of the entire workflow.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you will have a fully functioning **Multi-Tenant SaaS** prototype for **Marketing Mix Modeling**. Each tenant sees their own branded interface, while the back-end MMM logic processes their marketing data. The entire system uses mock data and minimal branding tweaks but can be extended with the production features in section 9 to create a robust, scalable solution.

If you have any questions about specific tasks or best practices, reach out or consult relevant documentation for Next.js, Python, or any libraries you use for data visualization and modeling. Remember that this blueprint is designed to keep you organized so you can deliver a polished, scalable solution.
