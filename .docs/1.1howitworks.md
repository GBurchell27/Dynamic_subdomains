# How It Works

## In Summary

This multi-tenant SaaS platform enables marketing analytics as a service, with the following key features:

- **Dynamic Subdomains**: Each client accesses their custom-branded experience through their own subdomain (e.g., `clientA.yourapp.com`).
- **White-label Branding**: Companies (tenants) have personalized branding, colors, logos, and customized features.
- **Unified Codebase**: A single codebase powers all tenant experiences, significantly reducing maintenance overhead.
- **Marketing Mix Modeling**: Specialized MMM analytics help clients understand marketing effectiveness.
- **Flexible User Permissions**: Tenant administrators can manage their users' access to specific features and data.

## User Journey Overview

### 1. Public Landing Page (`yourapp.com`)

The main landing page serves as the entry point for new visitors and returning users:

- **Navigation Bar**: Modern, responsive design with clear pathways to product information, pricing, and login
- **Value Proposition**: Clear explanation of the marketing analytics platform benefits
- **Feature Highlights**: Showcases MMM capabilities, data visualization, and customization options
- **Client Testimonials**: Social proof from existing tenants (with their branding)
- **Call-to-Action**: Buttons for "Request Demo" and "Login"

**Technical Implementation**:
- Standard Next.js page without tenant-specific theming
- Optimized for SEO and conversion
- Authentication state detection to redirect logged-in users to their dashboard

### 2. Authentication Flow

Users can access the platform through multiple authentication pathways:

- **Direct Login**: Via `yourapp.com/login` with email/password credentials
- **Subdomain Access**: Visiting `tenant.yourapp.com` presents a tenant-branded login screen
- **SSO Integration**: Optional single sign-on through tenant's identity provider
- **Password Recovery**: Self-service password reset workflow

**Technical Implementation**:
- Supabase Auth handles authentication with JWT tokens
- Tenant context embedded in tokens via custom claims
- Middleware detection of subdomains to apply appropriate branding
- Session persistence with secure HTTP-only cookies

### 3. Tenant Dashboard

After authentication, users enter their tenant-specific dashboard:

- **Branded Experience**: The entire UI reflects the tenant's brand colors, logo, and styling
- **Navigation Sidebar**: Quick access to all available modules (based on tenant's subscription)
- **Marketing Analytics Overview**:
  - Performance metrics summary with KPIs
  - Campaign performance visualization
  - ROI analysis by channel
  - Trend analysis with historical data
- **MMM Insights**:
  - Attribution modeling results
  - Channel effectiveness comparison
  - Budget allocation recommendations
  - "What-if" scenario planning tools
- **Report Generation**: Export capabilities for presentations and stakeholder sharing
- **User Preferences**: Personal settings for dashboard views and notification preferences

**Technical Implementation**:
- Tenant-specific layout component that wraps all authenticated pages
- Dynamic theming through Tailwind CSS variables set based on tenant configuration
- Row-level security ensures users only see their tenant's data
- Client-side caching with LRU patterns for improved performance

### 4. Admin Portal (Internal Use Only)

The administrative interface enables your team to manage all aspects of the platform:

- **Tenant Onboarding**:
  - Creation wizard with step-by-step setup process
  - Subdomain assignment and configuration
  - Branding setup (logo upload, color selection, theme customization)
  - Feature enablement based on subscription tier
  - Initial admin user creation
- **Tenant Management**:
  - Overview of all active tenants with key metrics
  - Usage statistics and subscription status
  - Configuration editing capabilities
  - Tenant-specific settings and customizations
- **User Management**:
  - Create and manage tenant admin accounts
  - Monitor user activity and engagement
  - Troubleshoot access issues
- **System Configuration**:
  - Global settings and defaults
  - Feature flag management
  - Email template customization
  - Integration settings

**Technical Implementation**:
- Protected by admin-only permissions in Supabase RLS policies
- Accessible only through specific routes with enhanced security
- Not accessible through tenant subdomains
- Database transactions ensure atomicity of tenant creation process

### 5. MMM Implementation Details

The Marketing Mix Modeling functionality is the core analytical capability:

- **Data Ingestion**:
  - API connections to major marketing platforms
  - CSV upload for custom data sources
  - Data validation and cleansing processes
  - Automated refresh schedules
- **Model Building**:
  - Customizable model parameters
  - Training on tenant-specific historical data
  - Validation against known outcomes
  - Confidence intervals and statistical metrics
- **Visualization**:
  - Interactive charts showing channel attribution
  - Time-series analysis of marketing performance
  - Budget allocation recommendations
  - Exportable reports for stakeholders
- **Scenario Planning**:
  - "What-if" analysis for budget changes
  - Forecasting tools for campaign planning
  - Optimization suggestions for ROI improvement

**Technical Implementation**:
- FastAPI endpoints process modeling requests
- Pydantic AI models handle the heavy computation
- Results cached for performance
- Tenant-specific models trained and stored separately

## Data Flow Architecture

1. **User Request**: Initiated from branded subdomain
2. **Next.js Middleware**: Identifies tenant from subdomain
3. **Authentication**: Validates user credentials against Supabase Auth
4. **Data Access**: Tenant-specific data retrieved via RLS-protected queries
5. **Business Logic**: Processed through FastAPI endpoints or Supabase Edge Functions
6. **UI Rendering**: Dynamic, tenant-themed components display results
7. **Action Tracking**: User activities logged for analytics and auditing

## Security Considerations

- **Tenant Isolation**: Complete data separation through Row-Level Security
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with short expiration and refresh capability
- **Authorization**: Fine-grained permissions based on user roles
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest for sensitive information
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive tracking of system access and changes

This architecture provides a secure, scalable, and highly customizable platform for delivering marketing analytics as a service, with particular emphasis on Marketing Mix Modeling capabilities.
